# Star Rating App in React

This project is a simple react star rating app. It is one of the milestone in my react journey.

## About the app

In this project, there are 3 events, the click, on mouse hover and mouse leave. This will select the active class by getting the current id of the star index. 

##
Once you click on the star, it is marked as active and the colour changes, on mouse over, it changes the colour based on the current index.
